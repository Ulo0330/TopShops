# TopShops
CS370 - project

Top Shops will leverage real-time data to identify trending products, allowing businesses to make informed decisions quickly. The primary goal of the software is to identify and display the top ten products ranked by popularity based on sales data while presenting real-time statistics such as daily popularity trends, average revenue, and historical top-selling products. Secondary goals include identifying and displaying the top companies, recommending products for events, and giving product analysis and trends. By automating the product research process, the software will reduce time spent on market analysis and increase the likelihood of selecting profitable items. This solution will not only enhance efficiency but also give businesses a competitive edge. With a user-friendly interface that presents information in a rich text format, Top Shops ensures that businesses stay ahead in the rapidly evolving market landscape.
